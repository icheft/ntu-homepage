# @icheft's NTU Homepage
(might as well be the simple one-page site I am going to use in the future ❤)

This is a really simple site built for my NTU homepage at <http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~b07705031/>.


## About

Feel free to fork the website and create your own one. If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/icheft/ntu-homepage/issues) or create a pull request.


## How to Use?
+ Fork this repo and change the name to `YOURUSERNAME.github.io`. You will see your site run perfectly on `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io` directly after that.

+ You can also use it for building sub-pages for your main site like [this](http://icheft.github.io/ntu-homepage/). Just simply go to setting, and check the `Source` box.

+ Alternatively, you can deploy it using Netlify as shown [here](https://app.netlify.com/sites/icheftatntu/deploys); the demo can be viewed [here](https://icheftatntu.netlify.app). For those who are not familiar with Netlify, please as well read their [documentations](https://www.netlify.com).

+ One more alternative is to deploy it to Vercel under the `now.sh` domain. You can start your own site by clicking this button:   
  [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/project?template=https://github.com/icheft/ntu-homepage)  
  Here are some domains used by the project: [`icheft`](https://icheft.now.sh), [`brianlchen`](https://brianlchen.now.sh), [`ntu-homepage`](https://ntu-homepage.now.sh)

+ For local build, click on `index.html` and you'll be able to see site locally. 

+ Last but not least, for [NTUers](http://ntu.edu.tw), you can always look up [this page](http://jsc.cc.ntu.edu.tw/ntucc/homepage/) on how to set up your own personal website with `http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~SID` domain.
